1. In Java, we can create an object of a class using the new operator followed by the class name and parentheses ().

Syntax : ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

2. The new keyword in Java is used to dynamically allocate memory for creating an instance of an object.

3. There are two Types of variables in java
	i)Primitive variables
	ii)Reference variables

4. Instance variables:
Instance variables are declared within a class, but outside of any method or constructor, and are created when an object of the class is created.
Instance variables have a default value and are accessible from any method or constructor within the class.

Local variables:
Local variables are declared within a method or a constructor, and are only accessible within that method or constructor.
Local variables do not have a default value, and must be explicitly initialized before they can be used.

5. Instance variables are stored on the heap as the part of the object while Local variables are stored inside the stack.

6. If multiple methods have same name but different parameters we call it method overloading.
