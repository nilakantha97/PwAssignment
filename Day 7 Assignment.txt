1. If the the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself then such types of programming languages are called as statically typed programming languages. Example : C , Java 
    If the the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself then such types of programming languages are called as dynamically typed programming languages. Example : JavaScript, Python

2. A variable is the title of a reserved region allocated in memory. It may be referred as the name of a memory location.

3. We assign a value to the variable by specifiying an equal sign and a value.

4. char, byte, short, int, long, float, double and boolean are primitive data types in java.

5. An indentifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable.

6. There are 5 types of operators in java:
	i)Arithmetic Operators
	ii)Relational Operators
	iii)Logical Operators
	iv)Assignment Operators
	v)Unary Operators
	vi)Bitwise Operators

7. Increment (++) : Increases value of operand by 1
    Decrement(--) : Decrease value of operand by 1

Example : 

public class IncrementDecrement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1=25;
        System.out.println("Post Increment : "+num1++);
        System.out.println("Pre Increment : "+(++num1));
        System.out.println("Post Decrement : "+num1--);
        System.out.println("Pre Decrement : "+(--num1));
    }
}
