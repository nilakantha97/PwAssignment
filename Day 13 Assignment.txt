1. The default value of an array in Java depends on the data type of the elements in the array. The default value for each data type is as follows:

Numeric primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double) are set to 0.
Character primitive data type (char) is set to '\u0000' (the null character).
Boolean primitive data type (boolean) is set to false.
Reference data types (e.g., String, Object, and arrays) are set to null.

2. No, you cannot pass a negative number as the size of an array in Java.

3. Arrays are stored in the heap area of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory.

4. Disadvantages of array:

i) Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed dynamically.
ii) Its stores only homogeneous data elements.

5. An anonymous array in Java is an array that is created without giving it a specific name. It's typically used when you need to pass an array as an argument to a method, or when you need to create an array that will only be used once and doesn't need to be referenced later in the program.

Example : 

public class Anonymous_Array {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Anonymous array
        System.out.println("Sum of numbers: " + sum(new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }));
    }

    static int sum(int[] numbers) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

6. We can traverse an array in different ways :
	i) By using for loop
	ii) By using while loop
	iii) By using do-while loop
	iv) By using for-each loop

7. 

-> length is a property of arrays in Java and represents the number of elements in the array. 

Example: 

int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int length = array.length; // length = 5


-> length() is a method of the String class and returns the number of characters in a string.

Example : 

String str = "Hello";
int length = str.length(); // length = 5
