1. An array is a data structure in computer programming that stores a collection of elements, each of the same data type, in a contiguous block of memory.

2. We can create an array using the new operator
Example : int[] numbers = new int[5];

3. No, we cannot change the size of an array in Java once it has been created. Arrays have a fixed size that is determined when they are created and cannot be resized dynamically at runtime.

4. No, we cannot declare an array without specifying its size in Java. Arrays have a fixed size that must be determined when the array is created. The size of an array determines the number of elements that can be stored in the array.

5. The default value of an array in Java depends on the data type of the elements in the array. The default value for each data type is as follows:

Numeric primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double) are set to 0.
Character primitive data type (char) is set to '\u0000' (the null character).
Boolean primitive data type (boolean) is set to false.
Reference data types (e.g., String, Object, and arrays) are set to null.

6. A 1D (One-Dimensional) array is a linear data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type.

Example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

7.

public class TwoDArray {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] numbers = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        System.out.print(numbers[i][j] + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
