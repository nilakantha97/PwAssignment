1. Conditional operators are used to evaluate a condition that's applied to one or two boolean expressions. The result of the evaluation is either true or false.

conditional operators:

&&   the logical AND operator.
 ||   the logical OR operator.
 ?:   the ternary operator.

2. Types of operators based on the number of operands are :
Unary operators
Binary operators
Ternary operator

3. The Java switch statement is used to execute one statement from multiple conditions. 

4. In Java, the priority levels of arithmetic operations are as follows:

Parentheses ( )
Exponentiation (^)
Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Modulus ( % )
Addition (+), and Subtraction (-)
Operations within the same priority level are performed from left to right.

5.Conditional statements are used in programming to control the flow of execution based on the evaluation of specific conditions. They allow a program to execute different code paths based on whether a certain condition is met.
The if-else statement is a Conditional statement used to test a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

6. Syntax of if else statement : 

if(condition){
	//statements to be executed if condition is true
}
else{
	//statements to be executed if condition is false
}

7. In Java, there are three types of iterative statements :
	i) for loop
	ii) while loop
	iii)do-while loop

8. In for loop the condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is false, the loop will not execute even once.

In do while loop the condition is evaluated after each iteration. This means that the code within the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once.

9. 

public class PrintNumbers {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
         System.out.println(i);
      }
   }
}
